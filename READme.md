### Dead Neurons <br>
While learning about the *Dying Neuron Problem* and how dead neurons hurt deep learning, I wanted to find a way to better visualize and understand what was going when dealing with zero gradient. <br>
<br>
With some help from *[Joel Chao](https://medium.com/@joelthchao)*, I created a some files to help visualize the dead neuron problem and how to resolve its issues. <br>
<br>
Thanks!
